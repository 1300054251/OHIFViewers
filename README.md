## Why?

Building a web based medical imaging viewer from scratch is time intensive, hard to get right, and expensive. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, you can use the OHIF Viewer as a rock solid platform to build on top of. The Viewer is a [React][react-url] [Progressive Web Application][pwa-url] that can be embedded in existing applications via it's [packaged source (ohif-viewer)][ohif-viewer-url] or hosted stand-alone. The Viewer exposes [configuration][configuration-url] and [extensions][extensions-url] to support workflow customization and advanced functionality at common integration points.

If you're interested in using the OHIF Viewer, but you're not sure it supports your use case [check out our docs](https://deploy-preview-398--ohif.netlify.com/). Still not sure, or you would like to propose new features? Don't hesitate to [create an issue](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues) or open a pull request ^_^


## Getting Started

This readme is specific to testing and developing locally. If you're more interested in production deployment strategies, [you can check out our documentation on publishing](https://deploy-preview-398--ohif.netlify.com/).

### Setup

_Requirements:_

- [NodeJS & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

_Steps:_

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your forked repository (your `origin`)
  - `git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Viewers.git`
3. Add `OHIF/Viewers` as a `remote` repository (the `upstream`)
  - `git remote add upstream git@github.com:OHIF/Viewers.git`


### Developing Locally

In your cloned repository's root folder, run:

```js
// Restore dependencies
yarn install

// Stands up local server to host Viewer.
// Viewer connects to our public cloud PACS by default
yarn start
```


### Contributing

It is notoriously difficult to setup multiple dependent repositories for
end-to-end testing and development. That's why we recommend writing and running
unit tests when adding and modifying features. This allows us to program in isolation without a complex setup, and has the added benefit of producing well-tested business logic.

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory, and `yarn install`
3. To begin making changes, `yarn run dev`
4. To commit changes, run `yarn run cm`

When creating tests, place the test file "next to" the file you're testing.
[For example](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/blob/react/src/index.test.js):

```js
// File
index.js

// Test for file
index.test.js
```

As you add and modify code, `jest` will watch for uncommitted changes and run
your tests, reporting the results to your terminal. Make a pull request with
your changes to `master`, and a core team member will review your work. If you
have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out via a GitHub issue.

### Docker usage
Following the instructions below, the docker image will listen for DICOM connections on port 4242, and for web traffic on port 8042. The default username for the web interface is `orthanc`, and the password is `orthanc`.
#### Temporary data storage
````
docker run --rm -p 4242:4242 -p 8042:8042 jodogne/orthanc-plugins
````

#### Persistent data storage
1. Create a persistant data volume for Orthanc to use

    ````
    docker create --name sampledata -v /sampledata jodogne/orthanc-plugins
    ````
    
    **Note: On Windows, you need to use an absolute path for the data volume, like so:**
    
    ````
    docker create --name sampledata -v '//C/Users/erik/sampledata' jodogne/orthanc-plugins
    ````

2. Run Orthanc from Docker with the data volume attached

    ````
    docker run --volumes-from sampledata -p 4242:4242 -p 8042:8042 jodogne/orthanc-plugins
    ````

3. Upload your data and it will be persisted
