Why do we write tests?

- Increase confidance

## Kinds of Tests

Test's buy us confidence, but not all tests are created equal. Each kind of test
has a different cost to write and maintain. More costly tests

| Test Type   | Example                                                              | Speed            | Cost                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Static      | `addNumbers(1, '2')` was called with a `string`, `int` was expected. | :rocket: Instant | :money_with_wings:                                                       |
| Unit        | `addNumbers(1, 2)` returns expected result `3`                       | :airplane: Fast  | :money_with_wings::money_with_wings:                                     |
| Integration |                                                                      | :running: Okay   | :money_with_wings::money_with_wings::money_with_wings:                   |
| End-to-end  | When I click "Sign In", the page navigates to the dashboard.         | :turtle: Slow    | :money_with_wings::money_with_wings::money_with_wings::money_with_wings: |

### Static Code Analysis

Modern tooling gives us this "for free". It can catch invalid regular
expressions, unused variables, and guarantee we're calling methods/functions
with the expected paramater types.

Example Tooling:

- [ESLint][eslint-rules]
- [TypeScript][typescript-docs] or Flow

Static code analysis can't test business logic.

### Unit Tests

...

#### What should be unit tested?

Follow the top level exports. Anything that is exposed as public API should have
unit tests. These are th

#### What should NOT be unit tested?

You're testing implementation details if:

- Your test does something that the consumer of your code would never do.
  - IE. Using a private function
- A refactor can break your tests

### Integration Tests

### End-to-End Tests
