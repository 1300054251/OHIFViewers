# User Account Control

Making a viewer and its medical imaging data accessible on the open web can
provide a lot of benefits, but requires additional security to make sure
sensitive information can only be viewed by authorized individuals. Most image
archives are equipped with basic security measures, but they are not
robust/secure enough for the open web.

This guide covers one of many potential production setups that secure our
sensitive data.

## Overview

This guide builds on top of our
[Nginx + Image Archive guide](/deployment/recipes/nginx--image-archive.md),
wherein we used a [`reverse proxy`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy)
to retrieve resources from our image archive (Orthanc).

To add support for "User Account Control" we introduce
[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/about.html). Keycloak is an open source
Identity and Access Management solution that makes it easy to secure
applications and services with little to no code. We improve upon our
`reverse proxy` setup by integrating Keycloak and Nginx to create an
`authenticating reverse proxy`.

> An authenticating reverse proxy is a reverse proxy that only retrieves the
> resources on behalf of a client if the client has been authenticated. If a
> client is not authenticated they can be redirected to a login page.

This setup allows us to create a setup similar to the one pictured below:

{% include "./../_user-account-control-flow-diagram.md" %}

- All web requests are routed through `nginx` on our `OpenResty` image
- `/pacs` is a reverse proxy for `orthanc`'s `DICOM Web` endpoints
  - Requires valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- `/pacs-admin` is a reverse proxy for `orthanc`'s Web Admin
- `/auth` is a reverse proxy for `keycloak`
- All static resources for OHIF Viewer are unprotected and accessible. We have
  application logic that will redirect unauthenticated users to the appropriate
  `keycloak` login screen.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Docker
  - [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
  - [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)

_Not sure if you have `docker` installed already? Try running `docker --version`
in command prompt or terminal_

### Spinning Things Up

1. Navigate to `<project-root>/docker/OpenResty-Orthanc-Keycloak` in your shell
2. Run `docker volume create --name=keycloak_postgres_data`
3. Run `docker-compose build`
4. Run `docker-compose up`

### Configuration

- [Env vars in Nginx](https://blog.doismellburning.co.uk/environment-variables-in-nginx-config/)

### Authentication Flow

- [Keycloak JavaScript Adapter](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#_javascript_adapter)
  - Not used, as to not lock vendor
- [oidc-client-js](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js/wiki)
- [Diagrams of OpenID Connect Flows](https://medium.com/@darutk/diagrams-of-all-the-openid-connect-flows-6968e3990660)
- [KeyCloak: OpenID Connect Flows](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#authorization-code)
  - [Good description on SSO Protocols](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/2.5/server_admin/topics/sso-protocols/oidc.html)
- [Lua Resty Openidc Docs](https://github.com/zmartzone/lua-resty-openidc)

### Create a new "Client" in Keycloak

- What is a realm?
- What is a client?
- OAuth 2.0 and implict flow; why?
- Can we set all of this up via config instead of manual?

- Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1/auth/admin/` in your browser. You should see:

<!-- Login Screen -->

- Sign in with `admin`/`password`
- Configure: Clients --> Create Client
  - ClientID: `pacs`
  - Client Protocol: `openid-connect`
  - Click "save"
- Under our new client's `Settings` tab:
  - Client Protocol: `openid-connect`
  - AccessType: `Confidential`
  - Standard Flow: `off`
  - Implicit Flow: `on`
  - Direct Access: `off`
  - Root URL: `http://127.0.0.1`
  - Valid Redirect URIs: `/callback*`
  - Web Origins: `*`
  - Click "save"
- Select the "Credentials" Tab
  - Copy the `secret` value and save it for later
- From the left hand sidebar, select `Users`
  - Click "Add User"
    - Username: `test`
    - Email Verfied: `ON`
    - Click "Save"
  - Select the "Credentials" Tab
    - New Password: `test`
    - Password Confirmation: `test`
    - Temporary: `OFF`
    - Click "Reset Password"

### Rebuild Client

- Set in `config/nginx.conf`?
  - Env variable???
  - `2dc6244a-1cba-4dbd-b3d6-f7409c2f68b3`
- stop, `docker-compose up`

## How it works

_reverse proxy_

A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of
a client from one or more servers. The resources from these servers are returned
to the client as if they originate from the Web server itself.

[OpenResty](https://openresty.org/en/)

> OpenRestyÂ® is a full-fledged web platform that integrates the standard Nginx
> core, LuaJIT, many carefully written Lua libraries, lots of high quality
> 3rd-party Nginx modules, and most of their external dependencies. It is
> designed to help developers easily build scalable web applications, web
> services, and dynamic web gateways.

## Next Steps

### Deploying to Production

While these configuration and docker-compose files model an environment suitable
for production, they are not easy to deploy "as is". You can either:

- Manually recreate this environment and deploy built application files **OR**
- Deploy to a cloud kubernetes provider like
  [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/) **OR**
  - [See a full list of cloud providers here](https://landscape.cncf.io/category=cloud&format=card-mode&grouping=category)
- Find and follow your preferred provider's guide on setting up
  [swarms and stacks](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
